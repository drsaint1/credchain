### Deploying to Mainnet

1. Update `.env` with mainnet program IDs
2. Change `VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK` to `mainnet-beta`
3. Update `VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL` to mainnet RPC
4. Rebuild and deploy

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Connection Issues
- Ensure your wallet is set to Devnet
- Try refreshing the page after connecting
- Check browser console for errors

### Transaction Failures
- Ensure you have enough SOL for transaction fees
- Check that accounts have been initialized
- Verify contract status before performing actions

### Badge Not Appearing
- Wait a few seconds for blockchain confirmation
- Check transaction on Solana Explorer
- Verify you passed the test (70%+ required)

### IPFS Upload Errors
- Add your Pinata JWT to `.env`
- Check file size (max 100MB)
- Verify internet connection

## Security Considerations

- **Never share your private keys**
- **Review all transactions before signing**
- **Use reputable RPC providers**
- **Verify contract details before depositing funds**
- **This is a devnet demo - don't use real funds**
